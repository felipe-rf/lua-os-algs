# 🎮 Operating System Algorithms Visualizer

This project implements **animations** for classic **disk scheduling** and **page replacement** algorithms, using the **Lua** programming language with the **[LÖVE (Love2D)](https://love2d.org/)** framework.

## 📌 Objective

This project was developed for the **Operating Systems** course in the **Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering** at **UTFPR** (Federal University of Technology - Paraná), Dois Vizinhos campus.

## 🧠 Implemented Algorithms

### 🔄 Disk Scheduling (`/disco`)

- **FCFS** (First-Come, First-Served)
- **SSTF** (Shortest Seek Time First)
- **SCAN**
- **C-SCAN**
- **LOOK**
- **C-LOOK**

### 📦 Page Replacement (`/fifo-lru`)

- **FIFO** (First-In, First-Out)
- **LRU** (Least Recently Used)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **Love2D** installed

### Step by Step

1. **Run with Love2D**

   Once you have the repository set up, you can run the project with Love2D:

   - For **disk scheduling** algorithms:

     ```bash
     love disk/
     ```

   - For **page replacement** algorithms:
     ```bash
     love fifo-lru/
     ```
